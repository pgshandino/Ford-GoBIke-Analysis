# Ford GoBike

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv) with more details available here [here](https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems)

## Summary of findings

In the exploration, i discovered that there isn't any strong correlation between trip duration and other variables in the dataset. I found a rather surprising result with more female members in total compared to me after i computed and plot the frequency of the gender and the average trip duration among them. It is wothy of note that there does not exists a bike share for all trip option for customerss with all values being `no`. The subscriber on the other hand sees a higher number of male and female bike share for all trip. 

## Key findings

For the analysis, i focused mainly on the features that have a huge influence on the duration of trips. Afterwards, i plotted the distribution of the duration and proceeded to plot a log scalled version of the same distribution.

Subsequently, I examined the frequency of the main features under investigation including birth year, gender, type, etc. I incorporated different charts (violin, boxplots, scatter, grouped bar, scatter) to try and explore the data and present its findings.
